Welcome to the SJSU Library Security Demonstration

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a public app in which Library Administrators, SJSU Students, and the General Public can visit and utilize the Library Database.
Roles are divided based on the class of each individual, in which Admin will have various management roles and access to submitting, editing, and deleting objects within the system, with high authorities reciving aditional privileges.
SJSU Students and General patrons will recieve basic access to the SJSUL system, able to view its collection and manage their own account.

The App was built using a combination of Python, JavaScript, and HTML, with security being designed and implemented through SQL.
